### Hi there 👋, I'm Abdur-Rahman.

A developer by passion, I am a tech enthusiast who hopes to make the world a better place with my ever-growing skills.

I love to create softwares and programs and hope to materialize that into a tech company. Besides coding, I love to read, walk and meet new people.
